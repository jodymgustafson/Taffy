TypeScript library for creating web apps

This library contains a number of modules and classes that I use when developing single page applications in TypeScript.

Hilights include:

AudioLib module - Contains a number of classes for loading, managing and playing HTML5 audio.
Collections.Map - A generic typed Map
System module - Contains a number of functions and classes that make it easier to work with the JavaScript system.
System.AppStorage - A wrapper over localstorage with generic typing and application namespacing
System.Byte - A class for working with bytes (0-255)
System.Color - Classes for working with rgba colors
System.KeyCodes - An enumeration of JavaScript key codes for handling keyboard input
UI.CanvasContext2D - A wrapper and chainable high level drawing methods for HTMLCanvasElement 2D context
UI.Elements - Defines classes to make working with elements and event easier
